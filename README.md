# SCRAPBOOK

## Project Brief
Scrapbook is an app for family/close friends which chronologically lists photos/videos in dedicated rooms (close circle of friends, core family, extended family, cousins etc), which allows users to interact via chat/comments and share new content. This would be ideal for those who are looking to step away from social media and have their own little hub for consolidating and sharing memories.
